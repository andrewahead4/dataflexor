DataFlexor is a data management framework to allow easy extension of WordPress content.

== Description ==
Based upon the excellent Advanced Custom Fields, DataFlexor gives WordPress an easy to use way to create complex systems.

Rather than have to create a Custom Post Type for each post type simply take a single Custom Post Type and extend it with field groups. These can then be used to customize any post with both data and functionality.

With a hierarchy structure you can then create many systems from a help desk to a staff directory, in fact almost anything that has a need for a flexible data structure.
